The privacy of our visitors is extremely important. This Privacy & Cookies Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used by our site(s). 

<!-- With all this in mind; as an entity we really don't care about who you are and/or your personal data! Our site(s) is/are authored for fun; and as a means of archiving personal projects/works. Of course if a site takes off this may change, but we highly doubt it! -->

## Designation of the responsible authority

The person(s) responsible for data processing on this website is the site author(s) which can be contacted [here](mailto:{{ site.privacy }}). The aforementioned responsible party decides alone or jointly with others on the purposes and means of processing personal data(s).

## Log Files

As is true of most websites, we and/or third party service providers may gather certain information automatically through your use of our website(s). This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, the files viewed on the Site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and "clickstream data" to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the website(s). 

All of this information is not linked to anything that is personally identifiable. However third party service providers may use analytical software to understand this information. This software sends information to its licensor. Other sites and companies may also use this software. As a result, the licensor may collect information that, when aggregated by them, allows them to identify you individually. We have no responsibility for this collection and use.

This data is your IP address and which page you have visited on this website. The use of Google Web Fonts is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. As the operator of this website, I have a legitimate interest in the optimal display and transmission of my web presence.

## Cookies and Web Beacons

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other devices when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. 

Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device. Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience. You can find more information about cookies at [www.allaboutcookies.org](www.allaboutcookies.org)and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](www.youronlinechoices.eu).

Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their devices should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our websites. Instructions on how this may be achieved are featured within the [Managing Cookies section of this policy](#managing-cookies).

### Our Cookie(s)

We don't want to store any first party cookies when you visit our websites. Our site(s) are built using Jekyll and hosted via Github Pages in order to try and avoid such a situation. This being said third party cookies may be set either by some of the site(s) embedded content and/or by our third party service providers. 

Because of this; GDPR compliance means we have to store a cookie on your device to control the visibility of a banner that informs you that other sites may store a cookie on your device. 

This cookie we determine as a strictly necessary cookie! <!-- ...although we believe that metaphorically speaking its totally unnecessary and total madness :D -->

The following block details the cookie we store to log your acceptance of the policies outlined within this document. As you can see the cookie will expire after 31 days.

```

For example, we use them to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, identify your device for security purposes, analyze your use of our service, compile statistical reports, and provide information for future development of GitHub. We use our own cookies for analytics purposes, but do not use any third-party analytics service providers".

### YouTube Cookies

We often feature product videos on our website that are hosted on YouTube. Although the videos are made by us and displayed on this site, the content actually comes from YouTube, which is a third-party domain; therefore you may receive a YouTube cookie. We don't control the setting of these cookies, so it’s worth checking the third-party website for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.

The videos we embed are done so using YouTube’s privacy-enhanced mode. This mode may set cookies on your computer once you click on the YouTube video player, but YouTube will not store personally-identifiable cookie information for playbacks of embedded videos using the privacy-enhanced mode.

Read more at YouTube’s embedding videos information [page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en-GB).
